# CastorAnalytics
Desktop application for viewing summary statistics and advanced visualizations for your Castor EDC studies and sites.

## Background and motivation
Meet Nedim, a clinical PhD candidate at the surgery department of MUMC+. He works on a project to analyze rectal 
problems in surgical patients across the world. For this purpose he has set up a clinical study in Castor EDC where
different hospitals can capture relevant clinical characteristics. His study already includes more then 350 participating
hospitals. Nedim experiences trouble trying to keep an overview of patient inclusions. In his monthly news letter he
wants to show which hospitals are including the most patients. Also, if hospitals are struggling to include patients or
completing the corresponding forms, he wants to know about it so he can contact them and ask them wether they need help.

## Common tasks
Nedim needs at least the following functionality:

- Retrieving a list of studies
- Viewing study details
- Retrieving a list of study sites
- Viewing number of included patients across all sites
- Viewing form completion percentages across all sites
- Viewing site details

## Workflow
Nedim wants to view a table listing all sites in the CRAFT Audit Study. The table should have the following columns:

(1) Site abbreviation
(2) Site country
(3) Number of patients/records
(4) Average form completion percentage

The table should be sortable by (1) site country, (2) number of patients and (3) form completion percentage. The first
thing Nedim needs to do is start the application from his desktop.
